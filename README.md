# Cutie-Tanks

This is a arcade game where the last one alive wins.  
The players play as very cute tanks, and can shoot an unlimited amount of bullets / bombs at eachother.  
A player can only take 10 damage before dying. The last one standing wins. Matches are around 1 to 2 minutes and very chaotic. For now there are 3 levels to choose from, but I plan on making some more.

Also, there are skins. To join a game press down on the player select screen, and then use down to select a skin.

Controls
The game is designed with a xbox controller in mind, but any controller should work. To move use the left analog stick. To aim use the right analog stick. To shoot use the analog right trigger.
