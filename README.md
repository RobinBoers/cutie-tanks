# Cutie-Tanks

This is one of my favorite projects so far. It is a arcade game where the last one alive wins.  
The players play as very cute tanks, and can shoot an unlimited amount of bullets / bombs at eachother.  
A player can only take 10 damage before dying. The last one standing wins. Matches are around 1 to 2 minutes an very chaotic. For now there are 3 levels to choose from (including the debug level), but I plan on making some more.
AND there are skins! WOOHOO!
